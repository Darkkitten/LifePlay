passTime(hours_min, hours_max)

USE:
I initially intended this as a way to pass time during a scene, but it turned out too complicated due to stat depreciations. All it does now is add to the variable TimePassed, which can be useful for while loop I guess.

TYPE: Command, Non-Ref
RETURNS: /
THEME: Time
COMPARE:

EXAMPLE:
    While TimePassed < 3
        "The party continues ..."
        passTime(0.25, 1)
    Endwhile
    "The party ends."
